This is due to a mathematically rigorous framework - i.e. potential outcomes - that can explicitly formalize causal effects (estimands) of interest and their identification assumptions. An often-overlooked benefit of adopting a causal toolkit is that it can help create a bridge between statisticians and subject matter experts. For example, causal diagrams can visualize the interplay between various clinical factors and the paths on these diagrams can be used to identify effects of interest together with clinical colleagues. Additionally, causal effects can be defined with simple contrasts of potential outcomes which are generally more closely related to clinical questions than the parameters of statistical models. This mini symposium will equip participants with fundamental tools from causal inference to enable them to improve their collaborations with clinicians and other non-statistician subject matter experts. Through an introductory lecture on causal inference, a guided hands-on practicum in small breakout groups, and a panel discussion with causal inference experts, attendees of this mini symposium will have the chance to experience how causal inference can assist in improving collaborations between statisticians and clinicians."

    "text": "Mini-Symposium 3: Statistical Research needs to improve – on the important roles of simulation studies and guidance for analysis\nDate: Thursday morning, August 28th, 2025\nOrganizers: Anne-Laure Boulesteix, Willi Sauerbrei\n\nObjective\nAlthough new biostatistical methods are published at a very high rate, many of these developments are not independently evaluated, raising potential concerns about the accuracy and validity of the results. Similar to the well-known phases of research in drug development, Heinze et al. (2024) propose to identify four phases of methodological research. The first of the four phases (I) covers proposing a new methodological idea while providing, for example, logical reasoning or proofs. The three further phases aim at providing empirical evidence helping to evaluate the method’s performance in either simulations studies or real-world analyses, with a gradually increasing complexity of the settings and level of evidence. Phase II considers a narrow target setting, while phase III relies on an extended range of settings and for various outcomes, accompanied by appropriate application examples. Finally, phase IV involves investigations that establish a method as sufficiently well-understood to know when it is preferred over others and when it is not; including a systematic exploration of its potential pitfalls.\nIn a session of one hour, we will have four talks starting with an introductory presentation of the phases concept (Georg Heinze), followed by three presentations, each revisiting the development history of a specific important biostatistical method, in light of this concept. These three talks will aim at illustrating what phases of methods’ development and evaluation were considered and how they were implemented. Together, they may contribute to a further refinement of the phases of methodological research and stimulate discussions around these pivotal issues. Michal Abrahamowicz will speak about ‘Phases of development of the Weighted Cumulative Exposure modeling of time-varying exposures in time-to-event analyses’, the title of a talk by Willi Sauerbrei is ‘Investigating treatment effect modification by a continuous covariate – development of the MFPI (Multivariable Fractional Polynomial Interaction) approach’, and the third speaker will be determined soon.\nLead by TG3 (Initial data analysis), the project ‘SAPI – Statistical Analysis Plan for Observational Studies with Initial Data Analysis’ was registered on the EQUATOR website as a reporting guideline under development for observational studies. The project is in an advanced stage and will be presented by Carsten Schmidt.\nFurthermore, we will have three or four talks from topic groups or joint projects. These talks will center around deriving guidance for highly relevant issue in the analysis of observational studies.\nHeinze, G., Boulesteix, A. L., Kammer, M., Morris, T. P., White, I. R., & Simulation Panel of the STRATOS Initiative. (2024). Phases of methodological research in biostatistics—building the evidence base for new methods. Biometrical Journal, 66(1), 2200222."

We will also demonstrate how these recommendations can be easily implemented following practical validation. Application of these recommendation will ensure that PRO objectives can be translated into meaningful design, analysis and reporting considerations. This symposium is relevant not only for statisticians but also for other stakeholders (such as clinicians, patients, pharmaceutical industry, …). As a large part of the recommendation are aimed at improving communication and understanding of PRO objectives so that the results of cancer clinical trials can be interpreted by all in a standardized manner."

This course will describe how, in these challenging situations, machine learning and variable selection procedures can be used to infer causal effects. The first part is a high level overview of how and why this methodology works, touching on recent developments in ‘double machine learning’ and ‘targeted maximum likelihood estimation’. In the second part the participants will exercise the concepts and methods explained during the first part via the analysis of real data sets.\nThis introductory course is aimed at researchers in the (pharmaceutical) industry and academia working with observational as well as trial data; a basic understanding of causal inference can be helpful but is not necessary. We foresee a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises using R."

White, UCL, United Kingdom\n\nSimulation studies are an invaluable tool for biostatistical research, as you will see at the ISCB46 conference this week, where they will play a prominent role in many presentations. You may even be presenting one of your own. Do you have the confidence to thoughtfully critique someone’s simulation study, or to defend yours? Although it is tempting to think of a simulation studies as a mere coding exercise, we have a rather different view. This short course will focus on the design of simulation studies, following the ADEMP framework (Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Estimands, Methods of Analysis, Performance measures). Practical sessions will be interactive rather than computer-based, involving group discussions and debates on issues around the design of simulation studies."

Network meta-analysis can be used to estimate the relative treatmenteffects between any pair of interventions in the network, it increases precision compared to using only direct evidence, and it can produce a hierarchy of the interventions.\nIn the morning session of this full-day course we will demonstrate the assumptions and methods of network meta-analysis and network meta-regression with interactive lectures and practical exercise. In the afternoon we will introduce advanced topics in network meta-analysis, such as the use of individual participant data, component network meta-analysis for composite interventions, and dose-response analysis.\nThe course is designed for participants who are familiar with meta-analysis and Bayesian statistics. By the end of the course, participants will be able to:\n\nUnderstand and assess the assumptions underlying the validity of indirect comparisonsand network meta-analysis\nEstimate the relative treatment effects between any pair of interventions within a network of studies and present them in a transparent way\nAssess and test for inconsistency within a network of interventions\nFormulate a network meta-regression model and interpret the results and output\nObtain an overview of advanced methods and extensions in network meta-analysis\n\nThe practical exercises will be performed in the statistical software R."

Nonetheless, software engineering principles are often neglected in biostatistics: most biostatisticians know a programming language (such as R) but lack formal training in writing reusable and reliable code.\nThis course aims to equip participants with the essential software engineering practices required to develop and maintain robust R packages. With the growing demand for reproducible research and the increasing complexity of statistical methods developed for multidimensional data, writing high-quality R packages has become a critical skill for statisticians to prototype, develop, and disseminate novel methods and push their adoption in practice. The course will focus on the key principles of software engineering, such as workflows, modular design, version control, testing, documentation, and quality indicators. Focussing on these aspects ensures the reliability and sustainability of R packages.\nParticipants will learn how to structure their R packages following best practices and making use of tools that streamline the development process. The course will also cover version control using Git, allowing participants to manage code changes effectively and collaborate with others. A significant emphasis will be placed on writing and running unit tests, ensuring that packages are error-free and behave as expected across different environments and over time.\nFurthermore, the course will cover quality indicators for R packages and explore techniques for writing effective documentation, enabling users to pick, understand, and use statistical software packages effectively.\nBy the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of good software engineering principles tailored to R package development, enabling them to build packages that are not only functional but also reliable, reusable, and easy to maintain."

Thall, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, United States of America\n\nThis half day short course will present statistical concepts and methods related to precision, or ‘personalized’ medicine, which uses individual patient covariates to choose treatment or doses. The topics are drawn from the book, ‘Bayesian Precision Medicine’ published by Chapman and Hall in 2024. To start, the problem of comparing immunotherapy to prayer for treating a severe disease will be discussed. Basic concepts of causal inference will be reviewed, including bias correction methods for analyzing observational data, causal diagrams, with both toy and real-world illustrative examples. Two clinical trial designs will be reviewed that aim to identify optimal subgroup-specific doses or treatments in particular medical settings, each using a utility of a multivariate outcome. The first is a phase 1-2 design that uses the joint utility of five time-to-event outcomes to optimize patient subgroup-specific natural killer cell doses for treating advanced leukemia or lymphoma. The second design does phase 2 treatment screening and selection, illustrated by a randomized three-arm trial to compare targeted agents. Two data analyses that apply Bayesian nonparametric regression models to identify optimal covariate-specific treatments then will be presented. The first analysis uses observational data to identify optimal covariate-specific doses of intravenous busulfan as part of the preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The second is a re-analysis of a published dataset from a randomized trial, with a joint utility of progression free survival time and total toxicity burden used to choose optimal personalized targeted therapies for advanced breast cancer."

They provide a comprehensive framework to analyze and understand complex medical phenomena, making them invaluable in research aimed at improving patient care, guiding public health policies, and advancing medical science. Extensions of the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard and of the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function allow for a detailed assessment of the dynamics of complex disease processes and patient trajectories, and the effect of covariates on these patterns.\nIn the first half we offer a brief coverage of basic concepts and techniques in multi-state models, focusing on non- and semi-parametric (Cox-model based) Markov models. We start with an introduction to important concepts, in particular transition intensities (rates) and transition probabilities (risks) and the relation between them, viewing multi-state models as an extension of competing risks models. We continue with methods for assessment of the effect of covariates on the transition intensities through proportional hazards models. Throughout the course, all steps needed for a multi-state analysis will be illustrated with examples and syntax based on the mstate package in R.\nIn the second half we focus on two selected topics related to more recent advancements in multi-state modelling. The first concerns the Markov assumption. We discuss formal tests for the Markov assumption. We explore estimation of transition probabilities that are consistent also when the Markov assumption is violated, in particular the landmark Aalen-Johansen estimator, and extensions like the hybrid landmark Aalen-Johansen estimator. The second topic concerns incorporation of relative survival in multi-state models. This allows to split mortality in excess and background mortality with and without intermediate events. Two different models for assessing the impact of covariates on the excess hazard will be introduced: the Cox model and Aalen’s additive hazards model."

Such contact certainly includes students supervised by or in the same department as Subcommittee members and may also include professional contact with the project as well as family links. The Subcommittee member with a conflict of interest in the submission will not grade it, other grades being scaled accordingly, and will not participate in discussions of that submission.\nApplicants must be able to travel to the meeting and present their work to be selected as the StCA winners.\nThe Society intends to make three awards.

    "text": "Basel – Switzerland’s Capital for Art and Culture\nNestled in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Rhine, Basel is a pocket-sized metropolis that combines proverbial Swiss quality with a multicultural population.\nThe city is the centre of the idyllic tri-border region of Switzerland, Germany and France – lying between the Swiss Jura, Germany’s Black Forest and the Vosges in Alsace. The narrow alleyways and hidden squares with over 200 fountains as well as the many century-old buildings and eye-catching sights such as the remarkable and richly ornamented Town Hall or the Cathedral, that has stood gracefully above the city for over 1000 years, combine to make Basel’s Old Town one of the most beautiful and intact of its kind in Europe. In hardly any other cityscape in Europe do historic buildings from the 14th and 15th century blend so harmoniously with contemporary buildings.\nIt was not without reason that Basel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. Just a few steps away from the picturesque Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta or the Basel-based Herzog & de Meuron. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world. Buildings such as the Roche Towers, Novartis Pavillon, Basel Exhibition Centre, Fondation Beyeler or Museum Tinguely are the modern landmarks.\nIn Basel, art can be seen wherever you go, whether strolling through the Old Town or when visiting one of the almost 40 museums. With their themed collections, the museums have something for every taste, and many have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. Kunstmuseum Basel, whose history dates back to 1661, is one of the world’s very first museums. Its collection includes many major works of art from the last 700 years. Wandering through the halls, you will discover a veritable “Who’s Who” of classical modernism, from Pablo Picasso to Henri Matisse and Joan Miró to Paul Klee. Small wonder then, that London’s The Times named the museum the fifth best in the world in 2013.\nWalking around Basel and letting your eyes wander to the right and left (and sometimes upwards) from time to time, you will be rewarded: you will discover impressive street art and graffiti everywhere in the city centre. National and international artists are also constantly creating new, colourful artworks on the outskirts of the city. Urban art has become an integral part of the art scene in recent years and is now an indispensable element of urban tourism in Basel.\n\nBaselCard\nThe BaselCard is offered as a free bonus with every booking at a Basel hotel, hostel, bed and breakfast or apartment. You will receive your personal guest card when you check in, and you can also load it to your smartphone as a web app.\nSome of the main advantages of the BaselCard at a glance:\n\nFree travel on all public transport in Basel throughout your entire stay, including your initial journey to your hotel from EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg or one of the three train stations in Basel (Basel SBB train station, Basel Bad Bhf and Basel SNCF). For your initial journey the booking confirmation of your accommodation serves as a free ticket for this transfer.\n50% discount\n\non museum entrances and the entrance to Basel Zoo\non the public walking tour of the Basel Old Town and the tour on the sightseeing bus\nand many additional touristic offers\n\n\nFor more information, see www.basel.com/en/baselcard."

In addition, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city.\nWith the BaselCard you enjoy the museums in Basel at half price for admisssion – including for special exhibitions.\n\nKunstmuseum Basel\nOne of the world’s best-known museums, the Kunstmuseum Basel features a prestigious collection – the first ever publicly accessible art collection – and internationally acclaimed exhibitions that provide unforgettable art experiences. The collection of over 300,000 pieces includes artworks by Hans Holbein, Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Andy Warhol.\n\n\nFondation Beyeler\nThe museum in Riehen near Basel is internationally renowned for its high-calibre exhibitions and its major collection of modern and contemporary art. The museum building was designed by Renzo Piano, is set in an idyllic park with venerable trees and water lily ponds. It boasts a unique location in the heart of a local recreation area, loverlooking fields, pastures and vineyards close to the foothills of the Black Forest.\n\n\nMuseum Tinguely\nDesigned by Ticino architect Mario Botta and opened in 1996, Museum Tinguely is situated right on the bank of the Rhine. It houses the largest collection of works by Jean Tinguely (1925–1991), one of the most innovative and important Swiss artists of the 20th century. Vibrancy, laughter, amazement and discovery – this museum stimulates the senses and brings art to the beholder. Jean Tinguely’s kinetic works make him one of the most eminent pioneers in the post-1950 art world. The permanent exhibition showcases a compilation of his work spanning four decades – from early, filigree reliefs to the monumental machine sculptures of the 1980s.\n\n\nVitra Design Museum\nThe Vitra Design Museum is among the world’s most prominent museums of design.

    "text": "Modern Architecture\nBasel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. The number of buildings designed by world-famous architects in such close proximity is unsurpassed, all in the midst of an architectural setting that has evolved over centuries. The Swiss architectural scene has an appeal that extends well beyond the country’s borders. Numerous Swiss architectural firms have attracted attention all over the world in recent decades with a series of outstanding creations. Many of the renowned firms hail from Basel such as Christ & Gantenbein, Diener & Diener Architects and Herzog & de Meuron. They have all helped to lay the foundation of a lively architectural scene in Basel.\nJust a few steps away from the picturesque and well-preserved Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world.\n\nRoche Towers\nThe Roche Towers, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, can rightly be viewed as a modern landmark of Basel – but as the tallest office buildings in Switzerland, they can be seen far outside the city limits, too.\nThese two skyscrapers are home to the offices of the Roche pharmaceutical group. Building 1 was completed in 2015 and, at 178 metres, was the tallest office building in Switzerland until it was overtaken by Building 2 in 2022.\nBuilding 2 is 205 metres tall and has a total of 50 floors. It is one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient office buildings in the world.\n\n\nGoetheanum Dornach\nThe Goetheanum is situated in Dornach, around 10 kilometres outside the city centre. It serves as the head office and conference venue of the General Anthroposophical Society and boasts a distinctive shape, which has also inspired the architects of neighbouring buildings.\nFollowing the destruction of the original Goetheanum building in an arson attack in 1923, the current building was constructed between 1925 and 1928. Both were designed by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. The monumental exposed-concrete building is particularly striking, owing to the almost complete absence of right angles.\n\n\nNovartis Campus\nWith about 20 buildings designed by top international architects, the Novartis Campus is a true Mecca of modern architecture. f you are interested in top-class architecture, appreciate short distances and also enjoy quiet moments in green surroundings, then the Novartis Campus, open to the public on working days, is just the place for you.\nThe list of architects who have put their stamp on the Novartis Campus reads like a who’s who of architecture: Diener & Diener kicked things off in 2005, followed by SANAA and Peter Märkli (both 2006), Marco Serra (2007), Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani and Adolf Krischanitz (both 2008), Frank O. Gehry, José Rafael Moneo Vallès and Fumihiko Maki (all 2009), Tadao Ando, David Chipperfield and Yoshio Taniguchi (all 2010), Eduardo Souto de Moura and Álvaro Siza (both 2011), Rahul Mehrotra (2013), Juan Navarro Baldeweg (2014) and Herzog & de Meuron (2015). For the time being, the final piece of Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani’s master plan scheduled for completion by 2030 is the Novartis Pavillon – conceived by Michele De Lucchi.\nIf you’re coming to see the Novartis Pavillon with its artistically luminous zero-energy media facade, you’d best plan enough time to visit the “Wonders of Medicine” exhibition, where four interactive areas (exploring life, disease, the history of medicine and the future of healthcare) invite you to delve into the secrets of the life sciences. The Novartis Pavillon is located in one of the carefully designed green spaces bearing the signatures of leading landscape-architecture luminaries, such as Peter Walker, Günther Vogt and Guido Hager. A diverse collection of artworks – including a sculpture by Richard Serra, art within architecture by Jenny Holzer, a sound installation by Laurie Anderson and a 60-metre-high mural by Claudia Comte – make your visit complete.\n\n\nBasel Exhibition Centre / Messe Basel\nThe new Messe Basel trade fair building is one of the city’s newer landmarks. The central architectural urban feature of the hall complex, developed by Herzog & de Meuron, is the City Lounge.\nThis covered, public space not only marks the entrance to the exhibitions, but also functions as a meeting place for locals and visitors. The architects called the prominent hole in the middle the “Fenster zum Himmel” (“window to heaven”)."

    "text": "TODO:\n\nUpdate e-mail (sotirisroussos@yahoo.co.uk)\n\n\nFinancial support to participate in the 46th Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics is available to scientists and students from Developing Countries (Low, Lower-middle, and Upper-middle income economies, according to the World Bank list for the fiscal year 2025).\nIn order to qualify for financial support from the Conference Fund for Developing Countries (CFDC), applicants must submit an abstract for either an oral or poster presentation and be selected by the Scientific Program Committee (SPC) for presentation at ISCB46. Only original and unpublished work that has not been presented previously at a conference will be considered. One award per presentation for one author will be given, without transfer to co-authors. The awarded author’s primary place of employment/enrolment must be in a developing country. Please note that previous recipients are not eligible to apply.\nApplicants should submit their abstract using the ISCB46 abstract submission portal. As part of the online abstract submission applicants should indicate their request for consideration for financial support from the CFDC by checking the appropriate tick-box. At that time, they should also submit a PDF of a letter of application (on the official letterhead of the institution where the applicant is enrolled/employed).\nThe evaluation and selection for the CFDC award will be based on the SPC’s decision regarding the abstracts for oral/poster presentation. This will be administered by the CFDC Sub-committee comprising Thomas Jaki (ISCB Vice-President) as Chair, Elaine Pascoe (ISCB Secretary), and Sotiris Roussos (ISCB46 Local Organising Committee [LOC] representative). Any enquiry should be submitted to sotirisroussos@yahoo.co.uk, indicating in the subject line that the enquiry relates to the CFDC.\nSuccessful applicants who register for virtual participation will have the conference registration fee reimbursed. Those who register for on-site participation will be reimbursed for the cost of the conference registration fee, economy class travel, travel insurance, and reasonable costs for accommodation. Note that travel insurance is obligatory and should cover not being able to travel due to COVID-19. In case of travel restrictions imposed by authorities (e.g., a country cancelling all flights) that may not be covered by the insurance, ISCB will reimburse the incurred travel costs. Note that all the costs can only be claimed after attendance and presentation at ISCB46 and by presenting appropriate receipts. Further, claims in excess of €1300 will need prior approval from the ISCB treasurer. If, after receiving the CFDC support, a change from on-site to virtual attendance is made by choice and not necessity, only the cost of the registration fee will be compensated.\nThe CFDC will be entirely separate from the Conference Award for Scientists (CASc) administered by the National Groups Sub-committee and from the Student Conference Awards (StCA) administered by the Student Conference Awards Sub-committee. Those who apply for CASc or StCA, but are not selected, will automatically be considered for CFDC support if they qualify, and will be informed accordingly.\nThe closing date for applications is the same as the general abstract deadline."
