    "text": "Keynotes\nStatistical and causal perspectives on machine learning in estimating individualized treatment strategies\nErica E. M. Moodie\nThe predictive power of machine learning is often celebrated, but caution is also warranted due to the potential for algorithmic bias which often arises from classical statistical concerns such as confounding and selection bias. Statisticians are thus often wary of the use of machine learning in the context of treatment recommendations and other highly sensitive and potentially life-altering decision-making. I will discuss two examples in which machine learning approaches were incorporated into a classical statistical method to learn individualized treatment strategies that are designed to address confounding to yield causally valid conclusions. In the first, non-parametric ensemble learner is used in the context of an approach that is not robust to model mis-specification. In the second, probabilistic supervised learning in the form of Gaussian processes will be used to improve performance of inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators. In both cases, the use of machine learning is layered onto classical statistical approaches to causal inference that have been developed to address confounding in the context of observational data analysis. Relevant causal assumptions, and how they may (or may not!) be detected and mitigated will also be discussed.\n\nConfidence distributions: new tools to design, adapt and analyse clinical trials\nIan Marschner\nConfidence distributions provide a holistic summary of the information that the data contains about a parameter in a statistical model, expressed using a probability distribution over the parameter space. They provide a frequentist analogue of Bayesian posterior distributions, but without the requirement to specify a prior distribution. In randomised clinical trials, confidence distributions are particularly useful for summarising the evidence for a treatment effect, allowing the strength of evidence to be quantified using a confidence statement such as Conf(Benefit)=92%. In this talk, I will review the application of confidence distributions to clinical trials using various case studies and then present promising lines of future research. Confidence distributions are useful at all stages of a clinical trial, from design to monitoring to analysis. They are particularly promising for adaptive designs, where they can be used to adapt design features such as the randomisation probabilities, the sample size or the available treatments. These confidence-adaptive designs provide various advantages over other types of adaptive designs, by making use of connections with long-standing frequentist group sequential theory that allows less reliance on extensive simulation. In some contexts, confidence distributions may provide the advantages of a Bayesian analysis but with less complexity and sensitivity to assumptions. They have recently found their way into major medical journals and are a promising new tool for clinical biostatisticians."

Clinical research, if carried out rigorously and efficiently, provides timely results that have a direct impact on clinical practice, patient care and eventually public health. Research is characterized by multidisciplinarity and biostatistics plays an important role, contributing to all phases of its development: from the definition of the clinical/biomedical question, to the design of the study, the collection and statistical analysis of data, and finally to the proper documentation and communication of the results obtained. For this reason, the profession of biostatistician, or medical statistician, is exciting and interesting, since it implies a role as a scientist, a person who gets to the heart of the research content, contributes with good and innovative methods to produce original data, guaranties the methodological rigor that is necessary for deriving scientific evidence. The biostatistician ethical code of behaviour is also fundamental to preserve the integrity of research for the benefit of subjects involved in the study and of those who will be treated in the future according to the findings. In the presentation I will show, through my work experience as a medical statistician, how exciting it is the interplay between applied and methodological research and how important it is the contribution of our discipline in the production of better research and scientific evidence.\n\nDr. Lisa Hampson Advanced Methodology and Data Science, Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland\nTransforming methods into applications: reflections on the role of a statistical methodologist in the pharmaceutical industry\nI’ve been fortunate in my career to have had opportunities to work in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry, and the connecting thread has been a focus on methods to support the design and interpretation of clinical trials as well as inform expectations about how likely a study is to ‘succeed’. Many instances of my early career research arose from academia-industry collaborations, beginning with my MSc dissertation, then my PhD, and later a UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award in Biostatistics which featured collaborations with a range of partners. In 2016 I decided to leave academia, and since 2017 I have been based in the Statistical Methodology group at Novartis. Here my role sees me offer consultancy support to project teams on a variety of statistical topics; co-ordinate an early career development program for Novartis Analytics colleagues; and interact with external collaborators to advance methods development and dissemination. In this presentation, I will provide examples illustrating the main pillars of my work as a statistical methodologist in a large pharmaceutical company and the key skills I have needed to develop. Drawing on my experiences, I will also offer some personal reflections comparing and contrasting the day-to-day work of a methodologist in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDr. Karen Lamb Associate Professor, University of Melbourne\nEffective communication strategies for biostatisticians to establish and sustain successful collaboration\nEffective communication with collaborators is critical for a successful career in biostatistics. Although an essential skill, communication is rarely emphasised in university training for statisticians. Where offered, communication courses typically focus on written or oral presentation skills. While useful, these courses overlook effective strategies for day-to-day communication required by statisticians. In this presentation, I will discuss essential communication skills biostatisticians need and provide tips and examples of how I use these skills in my own work. I will describe how to establish collaborator trust, how to guide communication pathways, and how to value the experience you bring to a collaboration."

These centres generally include an initial training period where PhD students with a diverse range of relevant academic backgrounds are introduced to theory, methods and application in the centre’s subject area. There is a wide range in the research focus for these centres, from machine learning and data science to renewable energy and environmental science. I am a third year PhD student in the fourth and final cohort of a CRT in Genomics Data Science, which has students spread across six universities in Ireland, and I will discuss my experience of the PhD journey as part of this programme, including some of the positives and negatives that myself and my peers have found through studying for a PhD as part of a cohort."

    "text": "Basel – Switzerland’s Capital for Art and Culture\nNestled in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Rhine, Basel is a pocket-sized metropolis that combines proverbial Swiss quality with a multicultural population.\nThe city is the centre of the idyllic tri-border region of Switzerland, Germany and France – lying between the Swiss Jura, Germany’s Black Forest and the Vosges in Alsace. The narrow alleyways and hidden squares with over 200 fountains as well as the many century-old buildings and eye-catching sights such as the remarkable and richly ornamented Town Hall or the Cathedral, that has stood gracefully above the city for over 1000 years, combine to make Basel’s Old Town one of the most beautiful and intact of its kind in Europe. In hardly any other cityscape in Europe do historic buildings from the 14th and 15th century blend so harmoniously with contemporary buildings.\nIt was not without reason that Basel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. Just a few steps away from the picturesque Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta or the Basel-based Herzog & de Meuron. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world. Buildings such as the Roche Towers, Novartis Pavillon, Basel Exhibition Centre, Fondation Beyeler or Museum Tinguely are the modern landmarks.\nIn Basel, art can be seen wherever you go, whether strolling through the Old Town or when visiting one of the almost 40 museums. With their themed collections, the museums have something for every taste, and many have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. Kunstmuseum Basel, whose history dates back to 1661, is one of the world’s very first museums. Its collection includes many major works of art from the last 700 years. Wandering through the halls, you will discover a veritable “Who’s Who” of classical modernism, from Pablo Picasso to Henri Matisse and Joan Miró to Paul Klee. Small wonder then, that London’s The Times named the museum the fifth best in the world in 2013.\nWalking around Basel and letting your eyes wander to the right and left (and sometimes upwards) from time to time, you will be rewarded: you will discover impressive street art and graffiti everywhere in the city centre. National and international artists are also constantly creating new, colourful artworks on the outskirts of the city. Urban art has become an integral part of the art scene in recent years and is now an indispensable element of urban tourism in Basel.\n\nBaselCard\nThe BaselCard is offered as a free bonus with every booking at a Basel hotel, hostel, bed and breakfast or apartment.

    "text": "Modern Architecture\nBasel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. The number of buildings designed by world-famous architects in such close proximity is unsurpassed, all in the midst of an architectural setting that has evolved over centuries. The Swiss architectural scene has an appeal that extends well beyond the country’s borders. Numerous Swiss architectural firms have attracted attention all over the world in recent decades with a series of outstanding creations. Many of the renowned firms hail from Basel such as Christ & Gantenbein, Diener & Diener Architects and Herzog & de Meuron. They have all helped to lay the foundation of a lively architectural scene in Basel.\nJust a few steps away from the picturesque and well-preserved Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world.\n\nRoche Towers\nThe Roche Towers, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, can rightly be viewed as a modern landmark of Basel – but as the tallest office buildings in Switzerland, they can be seen far outside the city limits, too.\nThese two skyscrapers are home to the offices of the Roche pharmaceutical group. Building 1 was completed in 2015 and, at 178 metres, was the tallest office building in Switzerland until it was overtaken by Building 2 in 2022.\nBuilding 2 is 205 metres tall and has a total of 50 floors. It is one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient office buildings in the world.\n\n\nGoetheanum Dornach\nThe Goetheanum is situated in Dornach, around 10 kilometres outside the city centre. It serves as the head office and conference venue of the General Anthroposophical Society and boasts a distinctive shape, which has also inspired the architects of neighbouring buildings.\nFollowing the destruction of the original Goetheanum building in an arson attack in 1923, the current building was constructed between 1925 and 1928. Both were designed by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. The monumental exposed-concrete building is particularly striking, owing to the almost complete absence of right angles.\n\n\nNovartis Campus\nWith about 20 buildings designed by top international architects, the Novartis Campus is a true Mecca of modern architecture. f you are interested in top-class architecture, appreciate short distances and also enjoy quiet moments in green surroundings, then the Novartis Campus, open to the public on working days, is just the place for you.\nThe list of architects who have put their stamp on the Novartis Campus reads like a who’s who of architecture: Diener & Diener kicked things off in 2005, followed by SANAA and Peter Märkli (both 2006), Marco Serra (2007), Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani and Adolf Krischanitz (both 2008), Frank O. Gehry, José Rafael Moneo Vallès and Fumihiko Maki (all 2009), Tadao Ando, David Chipperfield and Yoshio Taniguchi (all 2010), Eduardo Souto de Moura and Álvaro Siza (both 2011), Rahul Mehrotra (2013), Juan Navarro Baldeweg (2014) and Herzog & de Meuron (2015). For the time being, the final piece of Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani’s master plan scheduled for completion by 2030 is the Novartis Pavillon – conceived by Michele De Lucchi.\nIf you’re coming to see the Novartis Pavillon with its artistically luminous zero-energy media facade, you’d best plan enough time to visit the “Wonders of Medicine” exhibition, where four interactive areas (exploring life, disease, the history of medicine and the future of healthcare) invite you to delve into the secrets of the life sciences. The Novartis Pavillon is located in one of the carefully designed green spaces bearing the signatures of leading landscape-architecture luminaries, such as Peter Walker, Günther Vogt and Guido Hager. A diverse collection of artworks – including a sculpture by Richard Serra, art within architecture by Jenny Holzer, a sound installation by Laurie Anderson and a 60-metre-high mural by Claudia Comte – make your visit complete.\n\n\nBasel Exhibition Centre / Messe Basel\nThe new Messe Basel trade fair building is one of the city’s newer landmarks. The central architectural urban feature of the hall complex, developed by Herzog & de Meuron, is the City Lounge.\nThis covered, public space not only marks the entrance to the exhibitions, but also functions as a meeting place for locals and visitors. The architects called the prominent hole in the middle the “Fenster zum Himmel” (“window to heaven”)."

    "text": "Program Abstracts\n\nSession 1\n\nHow Biostatistical Methods Mature: Understanding the Four Phases of Methodological Research\nGeorg Heinze1, Anne-Laure Boulesteix2, Michael Kammer3, Tim P. Morris4, Ian R. White4\n1Medical University of Vienna, Center for Medical Data Science, Institute of Clinical Biometrics, Vienna, Austria 2LMU Munich, Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, Munich, Germany 3Medical University of Vienna, Department of Medicine III, Division of Nephrology, Vienna, Austria 4UCL, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, London, UK\nSimilar to the well-known phases of research in drug development, Heinze et al. [1] identified four phases of methodological research in biostatistics. The initial phase (I) centers on the development of a novel method. It typically raises the rationale for the method’s relevance and novelty, and includes theoretical justifications or formal mathematical proofs. Basic illustrations or toy examples may be contained, but comprehensive empirical evaluation is usually not yet considered. This phase is often limited to a single publication presenting the new idea.\nIn Phase II, an initial evaluation in a controlled and limited simulation setting is performed. Typically, the method’s properties are tested under ideal or simplified conditions, and using well-defined, specific data structures. This phase may include an illustrative real data example and provide a first software implementation, but generalizability is not yet the focus. Many journal articles with biostatistical contributions could be assigned to this phase, but few of them make it to the next phase.\nPhase III comprises broad evaluations of a method across diverse settings to investigate a method’s wider applicability. This usually includes simulation studies or example applications that span over various settings (e.g., different sample sizes, effect sizes, distributions, sometimes even different types of outcome variables). Alternative methods are well-selected based on evidence, and comparisons among methods are often conducted as neutral comparison studies, avoiding or at least disclosing possible biases. This phase helps in identifying strengths and weaknesses of methods across multiple use cases.\nThe final phase IV provides meta-methodological insights of a method already in use by practitioners (other than its inventors): it further clarifies when and why the method works well or poorly. It may comprise a narrative or systematic review of simulation results, or wide comparative performance studies, sometimes largely extending the originally intended fields of application. After that phase, a method is recognized as mature, enabling recommendations for or against its use in specific contexts or according to potential users’ level of statistical knowledge and experience. Finally, guidance documents or tutorials for applied users may emerge.\nIn this introductory talk I will discuss these and some further aspects of the classification and the impact it may have on different stakeholders, such as methodologist, applied researchers, reviewers and journal editors, and funders and policy makers.\n\nHeinze, G., Boulesteix, A.

In time-to-event analyses, the joint impact of past TVE values for person \\(i\\) is quantified as \\(WCE_i(u) = \\sum_t w(u - t)[X_i(t)]\\), where \\(u\\) is the current time when the hazard is assessed, and \\(X_i(t)\\), \\(t &lt; u\\), represent TVE values observed at earlier times. The essential component of the model is the weight function \\(w(u - t)\\), which is estimated using cubic splines and indicates how the importance of the TVE value observed at time \\(t\\), for the hazard at time \\(u\\) (where \\(u &gt; t\\)), varies with time since it was measured [1]. The WCE modeling, originally developed for Cox proportional hazards analyses [1], has been extended to competing risks, marginal structural models, and mixed effects linear modeling of longitudinal changes in a quantitative outcome [2].\nThe talk will present an overview of the phases of the development and establishing of the WCE methodology, including its consecutive extensions, and validation in simulations. I will discuss how and to what extent our work on the WCE modelling followed the phases identified by Heinze et al in their recent paper on the phases of methodological research in biostatistics [3]. In addition, further phases such as (a) establishing the need for the new methodological development, (b) proof-of-the-concept phase, and (c) refining the estimation and statistical inference, will be outlined.\nIn this context, three important aspects of real-world applications will be briefly discussed. (i) Firstly, I will emphasize the need to incorporate substantive knowledge, and the related challenges. (ii) Secondly, I will illustrate the ability of the WCE analyses to provide new insights into, and generate new hypotheses about, the underlying biological processes linking the exposure with the outcomes. (iii) I will also outline how some real-world results stimulated new methodological developments, necessary to address additional analytical challenges.\nFinally, the need of future research to carry out the additional phase, focusing on neutral simulations to further validate the WCE methodology and compare it with the existing alternative approaches, as recommended in [3], will be briefly presented.\n\nSylvestre M-P & Abrahamowicz M.

MFPI was formulated in the context of RCTs to look for an interaction with a continuous variable. The linear interaction model is the simplest special case. More generally, the aim is to investigate for an interaction of a categorical variable with a continuous variable in the framework of a regression model [1]. In the clinical context (RCTs), the key component of this method is the continuous treatment effect function (TEF). We used the bootstrap to perform stability analyses of such functions [2]. Our procedure was inspired by the STEPP (Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot) approach. The latter was in vogue some 25 years ago to investigate possible interactions in breast cancer research [3]. We compared the approaches in some examples [4].\nRegarding selection of the specific functions, we initially suggested four approaches with varying flexibility (FLEX1 to FLEX4). The details are demonstrated in a Stata paper in which we also compared MFPI with STEPP [5]. Using a large simulation study, we showed the advantages of MFPI over categorization-based methods. Regression splines were also considered as competitors and did not yield much better results. No other spline approaches were investigated [6, 7].\nWe proposed a strategy to average several functions [8] which allowed us to conduct meta-analyses for a continuous variable. Using IPD data from eight RCTs in breast cancer, we illustrated several methodological issues relating to averaging the eight TEF functions [9].\n\nRoyston, P. and Sauerbrei, W.

A historical perspective\nEwout Steyerberg1, Ben Van Calster2 for STRATOS TG6\n1University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands 2KU Leuven, Belgium\nIntro: Markers such as lab measurements and omics features hold promise to improve predictions for individual patients. Various measures can be used to quantify the incremental value of such markers. We aim to place two relatively recent measures in historical perspective: Net Benefit (NB) and Net Reclassification Index (NRI).\nMethods: The NB was introduced by Vickers & Elkin in 2006 [1], and Net Reclassification Index (NRI) by Pencina et al in 2008 [2]. Both papers have high citations rates (total &gt;4000 and &gt;6000; in 2024: 553 and 295 respectively). Both measures can consider the situation that a reference prediction model is extended with a covariate, either categorical or continuous (‘marker extension’).\nResults: The NB fits in the line of research on utility measures, where true positive (TP) classifications usually are weighted as more important than false positive (FP) classifications. NB is weighted sum of TP and FP, with the weight related to the decision threshold to classify patients as high vs low risk. A related measure is Relative Utility, as proposed by Baker [3].\nThe NRI is a reclassification measure, where higher risk is an improvement for those with an event, and lower risk for those without an event. For binary classification, the sum of NRI for events and NRI for non-events is equal to the improvement in Youden index (difference in sensitivity plus difference in specificity). Remarkably, Youden index and NB were already described in 1884 in a 1 page paper [4]. The NRI has been criticized for various reasons, including statistically improper behaviour (testing and estimation problems) and fundamental limitations (not accounting for consequences of classifications, which may be context-dependent, and a risk of misinterpretation) [5]. The NRI is equal to NB if the decision threshold is the event rate, so can be considered a simplified case of NB.\nConclusion: NRI and NB arose from different research traditions, which were already defined in 1884. NRI did not go through systematic phases of evaluation and should not be a prime performance measure for the performance of markers to classify patients as low versus high risk. Time will tell whether NB will trump NRI.\n\nAJ Vickers, EB Elkin. Decision curve analysis: a novel method for evaluating prediction models.

Specifying target estimands for long-term risks and benefits of novel therapies\nRima Izem1, Paola Rebora2, Nicholas Bakewell3, Mitchell Gail4, Suzanne Cadarette5 for TG5\n1Statistical Methodology, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland 2School and Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy 3Health Services Research, University of Toronto, Canada 4Biostatistics Branch, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA 5Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Canada\nThe STRATOS Study Design Topic Group (TG5) aims to offer guidance on planning and designing observational studies. Proper planning, informed by subject-matter expertise, ensures that research objectives are clearly defined, clinically relevant, and that the chosen study design is appropriate and valid. Despite its apparent simplicity, flaws in study design are frequently reported, highlighting the need for robust guidance from this subteam.\nOne TG5 topic of interest includes the review of main challenges in planning clinical trials or observational studies to answer causal questions about the long-term risks and benefits of treatments for chronic conditions. In chronic care, extended exposure to treatments raises questions about long-term safety or effectiveness, necessitating further studies.\nThe current practice often involves designing studies to compare the initiation of a new treatment with standard care on long-term outcomes. However, the treatment landscape is dynamic. Patients may experience multiple intercurrent events after initiating a treatment, such as dose escalation, switching treatments, therapy gaps, or concurrent treatments, which can influence outcomes. Ignoring these intercurrent events or censoring follow-up at these events allows estimation but muddies the causal inference. Therefore, estimands often focus on quantifying the effect of treatment initiation at the expense of complex exposure patterns.\nA potential alternative that TG5 is exploring is to ask cumulative exposure questions at fixed follow-up periods informed by drug utilization patterns in real-world settings.\n\n\nAn overview on recent works and activities of the STRATOS topic group TG3 “Initial data analysis”\nCarsten. O. Schmidt1, Marianne Huebner2, Lara Lusa3\n1Institute for Community Medicine, University Medicine of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany  2Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA 3Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technology, University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia\nThe key principle of Initial Data Analysis (IDA) is to provide reliable knowledge about the data underlying the main statistical analyses (MDA). The STRATOS topic group TG3 “Initial data analysis” aims to improve awareness of IDA as an important part of the research process and to provide guidance on conducting IDA in a systematic and reproducible manner in pursue of transparent and reproducible science. IDA focuses on the workflow from metadata setup, data cleaning, data screening, data quality assessments, reporting prior to conducting the MDA. This talk will provide an overview on these steps and introduces an international effort to develop a statistical analysis plan template in cooperation with all STRATOS topic groups for observational studies that incorporates a systematic IDA plan.\n\n\nAn overview and recent developments of the STRATOS Open Science panel\nSabine Hoffmann1 for the Open Science panel\n1Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, Germany\nThe scientific community, publishers and funders are increasingly encouraging open science practices with the idea that “scientific knowledge of all kinds, where appropriate, should be openly accessible, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative and inclusive” [1]. The STRATOS Open Science panel was funded to promote open science practices by providing guidance on ways to achieve this idea. This talk with give a general overview of the importance of open science practices in the design and analysis of observational studies in biomedical research and then focus on two ongoing projects concerning guidance on data sharing through synthetic data generation and a project that illustrates how to deal with analytical choices (“researcher degrees of freedom”) in the analysis of observational studies.\n\nParsons S, Flavio Azevedo F, Elsherif MM, Guay S, Shahim ON,Govaart GH, Norris E, Aoife O’Mahony A, Parker AJ, Todorovic A, et al. A community-sourced glossary of open scholarship terms.

This study compares methods for measurement error correction in such non-linear settings.\nThis blinded, multi-stage simulation project, a collaboration within the STRATOS initiative (Topic Groups 2 and 4), involved a Data Generation and Evaluation team and three Methods teams. These teams applied Bayesian methods, Imputation/Regression Calibration (MI/RC), and Simulation Extrapolation (SIMEX), combined with flexible modelling techniques (B-splines (BS), P-splines (PS), Fractional Polynomials (FP2), and Natural Splines (NS)). Datasets featured a binary outcome, a continuous covariate with classical error (X*), and a replicate substudy. The true non-linear functional form, covariate distribution, error variance, and error distribution were initially withheld. Phase 1 used 5 pilot datasets; Phase 2 expanded to 155 unique datasets by varying sample sizes, measurement error (ME) variance, error distribution (Normal, shifted-Gamma), and true functional forms. Performance was assessed by log Mean Absolute Error (logMAE).\nSIMEX methods consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy. P-splines, FPs, and NS generally outperformed BS, especially with SIMEX or Bayesian approaches. Following SIMEX, Bayesian methods (excluding BS) performed best, then RC (excluding BS), and MI. Bayesian BS combinations typically performed poorest, particularly with smaller samples. Accuracy generally improved with larger sample sizes and smaller ME. Linear relationships were estimated most accurately; J-shaped forms were most challenging. A shifted-Gamma ME distribution yielded slightly better accuracy for most methods. Notably, SIMEX was less sensitive to increased ME magnitude and, unlike MI and Bayes, showed no substantial accuracy improvement with larger replication substudy sizes."

Invited, topic-contributed and featured sessions might have different rules.\nDouble-check with the speakers how they want to be reminded about the timing during their talks. It is usually easiest to sit at the front and raise your hand to do this.\nPlease make sure that mics are used by the speakers and the audience if available.\nIt might be necessary to repeat questions from the audience and from virtual participants if the room setup does not allow interaction.

If needed, remind the speakers to finish if they get close to the end of their allotted time.\nOnce the speakers have finished their talk, stand up and invite the audience to ask questions, if time allows. If the time slot for the presentation (15 minutes) and questions is exhausted (usually after 18 minutes, which also include change-over to next speaker), no further questions should be allowed. Liaise with your LOC supporter regarding the virtual participants. If there are no questions from the audience ask one to start the discussion.\nAt the end of the session, thank all speakers and the audience."

Selection will be made on the basis of the abstract and a summary of a paper to be presented – for details, see the eligibility criteria and submission procedure below.\nApplicants should submit their abstract using the ISCB46 abstract submission system. In the online abstract submission portal, you are asked to check the box that indicates that you are applying for the 2025 Student Conference Award on your abstract. You will then need to additionally submit the documents described in the Student Conference Award track.\nThe closing date for applications is the same as the general abstract deadline (see the key dates page).\nApplicants should not register for the conference until they have heard the outcome of their application for the Award. Unsuccessful applicants who still wish to attend the conference will remain eligible for the Early Bird rate until three weeks after the outcome of their application is sent to them."

Acceptable topics encompass all areas of biostatistics, both methodological and applied. However, results of particular studies are of interest only if the analysis has methodological implications or shows a novel and interesting application of biostatistics to clinical or epidemiological research."

If the manuscript is co-authored, this letter should also include an indication of the level of involvement of the various authors.\n\nThe two files containing (b) and (c) should be uploaded via the conference abstract handling system by submitting to the Student Award track.\nAny applications submitted after the due date or incomplete or applications not adhering to the procedures above will not be considered."

Evaluation of applications will concern the quality of the research described and its relevance to the application of statistics to clinical and epidemiological research. The presentation of the application materials and the interest of the work to the ISCB members will be taken into consideration. The decisions made by the Subcommittee will be final.\nIn selecting papers for Awards, each member of the StCA Subcommittee will independently grade each paper allocated to them by the Subcommittee Chair. In the case of ties in total grades, the Subcommittee will make the final selection through discussion.\nMembers of the StCA Subcommittee must declare a conflict of interest in submissions from students with whom they have had substantial contact. Such contact certainly includes students supervised by or in the same department as Subcommittee members and may also include professional contact with the project as well as family links. The Subcommittee member with a conflict of interest in the submission will not grade it, other grades being scaled accordingly, and will not participate in discussions of that submission.\nApplicants must be able to travel to the meeting and present their work to be selected as the StCA winners.\nThe Society intends to make three awards. However, the StCA Subcommittee reserves the right to make more or fewer awards, or even none at all, subject to the approval of the ISCB President.\nApplications not selected for the StCA may still be considered for selection for an oral presentation at a Contributed Paper session or a poster presentation by the Program Committee, since the abstract has been also submitted separately via the conference abstract handling system. This holds unless the applicant indicates that they do not wish to have their submission considered further.\n\nIn case of questions, please, contact the ISCB Office at the following email: office@iscb.international."

This course will describe how, in these challenging situations, machine learning and variable selection procedures can be used to infer causal effects. The first part is a high level overview of how and why this methodology works, touching on recent developments in ‘double machine learning’ and ‘targeted maximum likelihood estimation’. In the second part the participants will exercise the concepts and methods explained during the first part via the analysis of real data sets.\nThis introductory course is aimed at researchers in the (pharmaceutical) industry and academia working with observational as well as trial data; a basic understanding of causal inference can be helpful but is not necessary. We foresee a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises using R."

White, UCL, United Kingdom\n\nSimulation studies are an invaluable tool for biostatistical research, as you will see at the ISCB46 conference this week, where they will play a prominent role in many presentations. You may even be presenting one of your own. Do you have the confidence to thoughtfully critique someone’s simulation study, or to defend yours? Although it is tempting to think of a simulation studies as a mere coding exercise, we have a rather different view. This short course will focus on the design of simulation studies, following the ADEMP framework (Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Estimands, Methods of Analysis, Performance measures). Practical sessions will be interactive rather than computer-based, involving group discussions and debates on issues around the design of simulation studies."

Network meta-analysis can be used to estimate the relative treatmenteffects between any pair of interventions in the network, it increases precision compared to using only direct evidence, and it can produce a hierarchy of the interventions.\nIn the morning session of this full-day course we will demonstrate the assumptions and methods of network meta-analysis and network meta-regression with interactive lectures and practical exercise. In the afternoon we will introduce advanced topics in network meta-analysis, such as the use of individual participant data, component network meta-analysis for composite interventions, and dose-response analysis.\nThe course is designed for participants who are familiar with meta-analysis and Bayesian statistics. By the end of the course, participants will be able to:\n\nUnderstand and assess the assumptions underlying the validity of indirect comparisonsand network meta-analysis\nEstimate the relative treatment effects between any pair of interventions within a network of studies and present them in a transparent way\nAssess and test for inconsistency within a network of interventions\nFormulate a network meta-regression model and interpret the results and output\nObtain an overview of advanced methods and extensions in network meta-analysis\n\nThe practical exercises will be performed in the statistical software R."

Nonetheless, software engineering principles are often neglected in biostatistics: most biostatisticians know a programming language (such as R) but lack formal training in writing reusable and reliable code.\nThis course aims to equip participants with the essential software engineering practices required to develop and maintain robust R packages. With the growing demand for reproducible research and the increasing complexity of statistical methods developed for multidimensional data, writing high-quality R packages has become a critical skill for statisticians to prototype, develop, and disseminate novel methods and push their adoption in practice. The course will focus on the key principles of software engineering, such as workflows, modular design, version control, testing, documentation, and quality indicators. Focussing on these aspects ensures the reliability and sustainability of R packages.\nParticipants will learn how to structure their R packages following best practices and making use of tools that streamline the development process. The course will also cover version control using Git, allowing participants to manage code changes effectively and collaborate with others. A significant emphasis will be placed on writing and running unit tests, ensuring that packages are error-free and behave as expected across different environments and over time.\nFurthermore, the course will cover quality indicators for R packages and explore techniques for writing effective documentation, enabling users to pick, understand, and use statistical software packages effectively.\nBy the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of good software engineering principles tailored to R package development, enabling them to build packages that are not only functional but also reliable, reusable, and easy to maintain."

Thall, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, United States of America\n\nThis half day short course will present statistical concepts and methods related to precision, or ‘personalized’ medicine, which uses individual patient covariates to choose treatment or doses. The topics are drawn from the book, ‘Bayesian Precision Medicine’ published by Chapman and Hall in 2024. To start, the problem of comparing immunotherapy to prayer for treating a severe disease will be discussed. Basic concepts of causal inference will be reviewed, including bias correction methods for analyzing observational data, causal diagrams, with both toy and real-world illustrative examples. Two clinical trial designs will be reviewed that aim to identify optimal subgroup-specific doses or treatments in particular medical settings, each using a utility of a multivariate outcome. The first is a phase 1-2 design that uses the joint utility of five time-to-event outcomes to optimize patient subgroup-specific natural killer cell doses for treating advanced leukemia or lymphoma. The second design does phase 2 treatment screening and selection, illustrated by a randomized three-arm trial to compare targeted agents. Two data analyses that apply Bayesian nonparametric regression models to identify optimal covariate-specific treatments then will be presented. The first analysis uses observational data to identify optimal covariate-specific doses of intravenous busulfan as part of the preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The second is a re-analysis of a published dataset from a randomized trial, with a joint utility of progression free survival time and total toxicity burden used to choose optimal personalized targeted therapies for advanced breast cancer."

    "text": "Multi-State Models: Theory, Applications and New Developments\nInstructors:\n\nLiesbeth de Wreede, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands\nHein Putter, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands\n\nThe Multi-state models play an increasingly important role in the analysis of time-to-event data. They provide a comprehensive framework to analyze and understand complex medical phenomena, making them invaluable in research aimed at improving patient care, guiding public health policies, and advancing medical science. Extensions of the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard and of the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function allow for a detailed assessment of the dynamics of complex disease processes and patient trajectories, and the effect of covariates on these patterns.\nIn the first half we offer a brief coverage of basic concepts and techniques in multi-state models, focusing on non- and semi-parametric (Cox-model based) Markov models. We start with an introduction to important concepts, in particular transition intensities (rates) and transition probabilities (risks) and the relation between them, viewing multi-state models as an extension of competing risks models. We continue with methods for assessment of the effect of covariates on the transition intensities through proportional hazards models. Throughout the course, all steps needed for a multi-state analysis will be illustrated with examples and syntax based on the mstate package in R.\nIn the second half we focus on two selected topics related to more recent advancements in multi-state modelling. The first concerns the Markov assumption. We discuss formal tests for the Markov assumption. We explore estimation of transition probabilities that are consistent also when the Markov assumption is violated, in particular the landmark Aalen-Johansen estimator, and extensions like the hybrid landmark Aalen-Johansen estimator. The second topic concerns incorporation of relative survival in multi-state models. This allows to split mortality in excess and background mortality with and without intermediate events. Two different models for assessing the impact of covariates on the excess hazard will be introduced: the Cox model and Aalen’s additive hazards model."

This is due to a mathematically rigorous framework - i.e. potential outcomes - that can explicitly formalize causal effects (estimands) of interest and their identification assumptions. An often-overlooked benefit of adopting a causal toolkit is that it can help create a bridge between statisticians and subject matter experts. For example, causal diagrams can visualize the interplay between various clinical factors and the paths on these diagrams can be used to identify effects of interest together with clinical colleagues. Additionally, causal effects can be defined with simple contrasts of potential outcomes which are generally more closely related to clinical questions than the parameters of statistical models. This mini symposium will equip participants with fundamental tools from causal inference to enable them to improve their collaborations with clinicians and other non-statistician subject matter experts. Through an introductory lecture on causal inference, a guided hands-on practicum in small breakout groups, and a panel discussion with causal inference experts, attendees of this mini symposium will have the chance to experience how causal inference can assist in improving collaborations between statisticians and clinicians."

Similar to the well-known phases of research in drug development, Heinze et al. (2024) propose to identify four phases of methodological research. The first of the four phases (I) covers proposing a new methodological idea while providing, for example, logical reasoning or proofs. The three further phases aim at providing empirical evidence helping to evaluate the method’s performance in either simulations studies or real-world analyses, with a gradually increasing complexity of the settings and level of evidence. Phase II considers a narrow target setting, while phase III relies on an extended range of settings and for various outcomes, accompanied by appropriate application examples. Finally, phase IV involves investigations that establish a method as sufficiently well-understood to know when it is preferred over others and when it is not; including a systematic exploration of its potential pitfalls.\nIn a session of one hour, we will have four talks starting with an introductory presentation of the phases concept (Georg Heinze), followed by three presentations, each revisiting the development history of a specific important biostatistical method, in light of this concept. These three talks will aim at illustrating what phases of methods’ development and evaluation were considered and how they were implemented. Together, they may contribute to a further refinement of the phases of methodological research and stimulate discussions around these pivotal issues. Michal Abrahamowicz will speak about ‘Phases of development of the Weighted Cumulative Exposure modeling of time-varying exposures in time-to-event analyses’, the title of a talk by Willi Sauerbrei is ‘Investigating treatment effect modification by a continuous covariate – development of the MFPI (Multivariable Fractional Polynomial Interaction) approach’, and the third speaker will be determined soon.\nLead by TG3 (Initial data analysis), the project ‘SAPI – Statistical Analysis Plan for Observational Studies with Initial Data Analysis’ was registered on the EQUATOR website as a reporting guideline under development for observational studies. The project is in an advanced stage and will be presented by Carsten Schmidt.\nFurthermore, we will have three or four talks from topic groups or joint projects. These talks will center around deriving guidance for highly relevant issue in the analysis of observational studies.\nHeinze, G., Boulesteix, A. L., Kammer, M., Morris, T. P., White, I.

We will also demonstrate how these recommendations can be easily implemented following practical validation. Application of these recommendation will ensure that PRO objectives can be translated into meaningful design, analysis and reporting considerations. This symposium is relevant not only for statisticians but also for other stakeholders (such as clinicians, patients, pharmaceutical industry, …). As a large part of the recommendation are aimed at improving communication and understanding of PRO objectives so that the results of cancer clinical trials can be interpreted by all in a standardized manner."

They are particularly promising for adaptive designs, where they can be used to adapt design features such as the randomisation probabilities, the sample size or the available treatments. These confidence-adaptive designs provide various advantages over other types of adaptive designs, by making use of connections with long-standing frequentist group sequential theory that allows less reliance on extensive simulation.

    "section": "Short description",
    "text": "Short description\nCausal inference is emerging as an indispensable tool for statisticians to properly answer clinical questions of interest. This is due to a mathematically rigorous framework - i.e. potential outcomes - that can explicitly formalize causal effects (estimands) of interest and their identification assumptions. An often-overlooked benefit of adopting a causal toolkit is that it can help create a bridge between statisticians and subject matter experts. For example, causal diagrams can visualize the interplay between various clinical factors and the paths on these diagrams can be used to identify effects of interest together with clinical colleagues. Additionally, causal effects can be defined with simple contrasts of potential outcomes which are generally more closely related to clinical questions than the parameters of statistical models.\nThis mini symposium will equip participants with fundamental tools from causal inference to enable them to improve their collaborations with clinicians and other non-statistician subject matter experts. Through an introductory lecture on causal inference, a guided hands-on practicum in small breakout groups, and a panel discussion with causal inference experts, attendees of this mini symposium will have the chance to experience how causal inference can assist in improving collaborations between statisticians and clinicians."

    "text": "Symposium outline (2h30)\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) in cancer clinical trials are used to directly measure the patient experience and are becoming increasingly vital in evaluating treatment risks, benefits, and tolerability. However, the lack of consensus among stakeholders often hampers the interpretation and comparability of PRO data.\nSISAQOL-IMI (Setting International Standards in Analysing PROs and Quality of Life Endpoints in Cancer Clinical Trials) is an international, multidisciplinary consortium funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative. Launched in 2021, this four-year collaborative project will publish its final recommendations in 2025, establishing standards for the design, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of PROs in cancer clinical trials. Recently, SISAQOL-IMI was honoured by the American Statistical Association (ASA) for its exemplary partnerships among academia, industry, patient representatives, and government organizations.\nIn this half-day mini-symposium, representatives of SISAQOL-IMI will present practice-changing highlights of the 146 total recommendations. More specifically, the symposium will focus on four key scientific areas:\n\nRandomised Controlled Trials (RCTs): Discussing how PROs can evaluate the comparative clinical benefit of interventions and describe the patient perspective more broadly.\nSingle Arm Trials (SATs): SATs often include PROs to explore g patient perspectives, support future PRO-related hypotheses in RCTs, and complement clinician-reported adverse events. SATs may be the best option when RCTs are not feasible.\nPresenting and Visualising PRO Results: Addressing the optimal presentation of PRO data for different stakeholder groups using graphic displays.\nClinically Relevant Thresholds for PRO Scores: Examining the interpretation of clinically relevant differences and changes in PRO scores, a challenging yet vital aspect due to varying definitions, terminology, and methodologies.\n\nThe symposium will conclude with a moderated panel discussion on the practical implementation of the recommendations and how these may impact the use of PRO data in drug development and clinical decision making.\n\nSession 1: Introduction (20 min – Johannes Giesinger)\nThe absence of clear PRO objectives has lead to uncertainty in cancer clinical trials, causing confusion in their analysis and reporting. Current practices often show inconsistent terminology, an inflation of analyses, and potentially conflicting results, hindering decision-making and cross-validation of PRO results across studies. Using estimands that reflect relevant and concise PRO objectives can improve the design, analysis, interpretation, and communication of PRO results. The terminology and framework of the initial SISAQOL recommendations will be presented, including a taxonomy of PRO objectives. We will also demonstrate how the estimand framework was used to bridge the gap from research question to actual analysis.\n\n\nSession 2: Randomised Clinical Trials (25 min – Jammbe Musoro)\nUnobserved data is a persistent issue in PRO analyses due to voluntary patient participation, characterized by intercurrent events and missing data. Intercurrent events affect endpoint interpretation and must be aligned with the intended PRO objective, especially in oncology where events like death are not uncommon. Strategies for handling missing data should consider potential informative relationships and assess robustness. Reporting data availability at each assessment timepoint using standardized completion rates and available data rates is recommended to address selection bias in an uniform way across trials.\n\n\nSession 3: Single Arm Trials (25 min – Saskia Le Cessie)\nSingle Arm Trials (SATs) face additional challenges due to the lack of a randomized concurrent control. Specifying PRO objectives using the ICHE9 (R1) estimand framework is crucial as current practices are hampered by unclear objectives. Strategies for handling terminal events like death vary, with the while-alive strategy often preferred for quality of life. Causal inference methods offer new opportunities for generating evidence, but untestable causal assumptions must be plausible and supported by sensitivity analyses. This session will explore these strategies and their application in SATs.\n\n\nSession 4: Results Communication and Visualization (25 min – Flora Mazerolle)\nThis session will highlight key SISAQOL-IMI recommendations for communicating PRO results from oncology trials, focusing on visualization. Key principles for transparency include aligning figures with pre-specified objectives. Best practices for including sample size details, missing data, and intercurrent events will be presented, along with a template for integrating intercurrent event data into PRO figures. Strategies for reporting statistical significance and distinguishing confirmatory analyses from exploratory findings will be discussed, aiming to improve the accessibility of PRO results for both expert and non-specialist readers.\n\n\nSession 5: PRO Score Interpretation Thresholds (25 min – Johannes Giesinger)\nThe heterogeneous terminology around thresholds for interpreting PRO data poses challenges in selecting such thresholds. SISAQOL-IMI has established a harmonized terminology differentiating types of PRO score interpretation thresholds, focusing on patient- and group-level data. These types of threshold correspond to specific statistical analysis methods to support their correct implementation and interpretation. This session will provide recommendations on reporting the use of PRO score interpretation thresholds in cancer clinical trial data analysis and interpretation.\n\n\nPanel discussion (30 min, all)\nThis interactive panel discussion will bring together the speakers to delve into the practical implementation of SISAQOL-IMI recommendations. The panel will include all session presenters and the discussion will focus on the challenges in harmonizing PRO objectives. Speakers will be asked to identify areas where these recommendations are expected to have practice-changing impact. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with the panelists through a Q&A format, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas and experiences aimed at improving the utility of PRO data in cancer clinical trials."
