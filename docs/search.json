    "text": "Basel – Switzerland’s Capital for Art and Culture\nNestled in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Rhine, Basel is a pocket-sized metropolis that combines proverbial Swiss quality with a multicultural population.\nThe city is the centre of the idyllic tri-border region of Switzerland, Germany and France – lying between the Swiss Jura, Germany’s Black Forest and the Vosges in Alsace. The narrow alleyways and hidden squares with over 200 fountains as well as the many century-old buildings and eye-catching sights such as the remarkable and richly ornamented Town Hall or the Cathedral, that has stood gracefully above the city for over 1000 years, combine to make Basel’s Old Town one of the most beautiful and intact of its kind in Europe. In hardly any other cityscape in Europe do historic buildings from the 14th and 15th century blend so harmoniously with contemporary buildings.\nIt was not without reason that Basel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. Just a few steps away from the picturesque Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta or the Basel-based Herzog & de Meuron. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world. Buildings such as the Roche Towers, Novartis Pavillon, Basel Exhibition Centre, Fondation Beyeler or Museum Tinguely are the modern landmarks.\nIn Basel, art can be seen wherever you go, whether strolling through the Old Town or when visiting one of the almost 40 museums. With their themed collections, the museums have something for every taste, and many have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. Kunstmuseum Basel, whose history dates back to 1661, is one of the world’s very first museums. Its collection includes many major works of art from the last 700 years. Wandering through the halls, you will discover a veritable “Who’s Who” of classical modernism, from Pablo Picasso to Henri Matisse and Joan Miró to Paul Klee. Small wonder then, that London’s The Times named the museum the fifth best in the world in 2013.\nWalking around Basel and letting your eyes wander to the right and left (and sometimes upwards) from time to time, you will be rewarded: you will discover impressive street art and graffiti everywhere in the city centre. National and international artists are also constantly creating new, colourful artworks on the outskirts of the city. Urban art has become an integral part of the art scene in recent years and is now an indispensable element of urban tourism in Basel.\n\nBaselCard\nThe BaselCard is offered as a free bonus with every booking at a Basel hotel, hostel, bed and breakfast or apartment. You will receive your personal guest card when you check in, and you can also load it to your smartphone as a web app.\nSome of the main advantages of the BaselCard at a glance:\n\nFree travel on all public transport in Basel throughout your entire stay, including your initial journey to your hotel from EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg or one of the three train stations in Basel (Basel SBB train station, Basel Bad Bhf and Basel SNCF). For your initial journey the booking confirmation of your accommodation serves as a free ticket for this transfer.\n50% discount\n\non museum entrances and the entrance to Basel Zoo\non the public walking tour of the Basel Old Town and the tour on the sightseeing bus\nand many additional touristic offers\n\n\nFor more information, see www.basel.com/en/baselcard."

In addition, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city.\nWith the BaselCard you enjoy the museums in Basel at half price for admisssion – including for special exhibitions.\n\nKunstmuseum Basel\nOne of the world’s best-known museums, the Kunstmuseum Basel features a prestigious collection – the first ever publicly accessible art collection – and internationally acclaimed exhibitions that provide unforgettable art experiences. The collection of over 300,000 pieces includes artworks by Hans Holbein, Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Andy Warhol.\n\n\nFondation Beyeler\nThe museum in Riehen near Basel is internationally renowned for its high-calibre exhibitions and its major collection of modern and contemporary art. The museum building was designed by Renzo Piano, is set in an idyllic park with venerable trees and water lily ponds. It boasts a unique location in the heart of a local recreation area, loverlooking fields, pastures and vineyards close to the foothills of the Black Forest.\n\n\nMuseum Tinguely\nDesigned by Ticino architect Mario Botta and opened in 1996, Museum Tinguely is situated right on the bank of the Rhine. It houses the largest collection of works by Jean Tinguely (1925–1991), one of the most innovative and important Swiss artists of the 20th century. Vibrancy, laughter, amazement and discovery – this museum stimulates the senses and brings art to the beholder. Jean Tinguely’s kinetic works make him one of the most eminent pioneers in the post-1950 art world. The permanent exhibition showcases a compilation of his work spanning four decades – from early, filigree reliefs to the monumental machine sculptures of the 1980s.\n\n\nVitra Design Museum\nThe Vitra Design Museum is among the world’s most prominent museums of design. It is dedicated to the research and presentation of design, past and present, and examines its relationship to architecture, art and everyday culture.

    "text": "Modern Architecture\nBasel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. The number of buildings designed by world-famous architects in such close proximity is unsurpassed, all in the midst of an architectural setting that has evolved over centuries. The Swiss architectural scene has an appeal that extends well beyond the country’s borders. Numerous Swiss architectural firms have attracted attention all over the world in recent decades with a series of outstanding creations. Many of the renowned firms hail from Basel such as Christ & Gantenbein, Diener & Diener Architects and Herzog & de Meuron. They have all helped to lay the foundation of a lively architectural scene in Basel.\nJust a few steps away from the picturesque and well-preserved Old Town you will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta. Numerous winners of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture that is unique in the world.\n\nRoche Towers\nThe Roche Towers, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, can rightly be viewed as a modern landmark of Basel – but as the tallest office buildings in Switzerland, they can be seen far outside the city limits, too.\nThese two skyscrapers are home to the offices of the Roche pharmaceutical group. Building 1 was completed in 2015 and, at 178 metres, was the tallest office building in Switzerland until it was overtaken by Building 2 in 2022.\nBuilding 2 is 205 metres tall and has a total of 50 floors. It is one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient office buildings in the world.\n\n\nGoetheanum Dornach\nThe Goetheanum is situated in Dornach, around 10 kilometres outside the city centre. It serves as the head office and conference venue of the General Anthroposophical Society and boasts a distinctive shape, which has also inspired the architects of neighbouring buildings.\nFollowing the destruction of the original Goetheanum building in an arson attack in 1923, the current building was constructed between 1925 and 1928. Both were designed by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. The monumental exposed-concrete building is particularly striking, owing to the almost complete absence of right angles.\n\n\nNovartis Campus\nWith about 20 buildings designed by top international architects, the Novartis Campus is a true Mecca of modern architecture. f you are interested in top-class architecture, appreciate short distances and also enjoy quiet moments in green surroundings, then the Novartis Campus, open to the public on working days, is just the place for you.\nThe list of architects who have put their stamp on the Novartis Campus reads like a who’s who of architecture: Diener & Diener kicked things off in 2005, followed by SANAA and Peter Märkli (both 2006), Marco Serra (2007), Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani and Adolf Krischanitz (both 2008), Frank O. Gehry, José Rafael Moneo Vallès and Fumihiko Maki (all 2009), Tadao Ando, David Chipperfield and Yoshio Taniguchi (all 2010), Eduardo Souto de Moura and Álvaro Siza (both 2011), Rahul Mehrotra (2013), Juan Navarro Baldeweg (2014) and Herzog & de Meuron (2015). For the time being, the final piece of Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani’s master plan scheduled for completion by 2030 is the Novartis Pavillon – conceived by Michele De Lucchi.\nIf you’re coming to see the Novartis Pavillon with its artistically luminous zero-energy media facade, you’d best plan enough time to visit the “Wonders of Medicine” exhibition, where four interactive areas (exploring life, disease, the history of medicine and the future of healthcare) invite you to delve into the secrets of the life sciences. The Novartis Pavillon is located in one of the carefully designed green spaces bearing the signatures of leading landscape-architecture luminaries, such as Peter Walker, Günther Vogt and Guido Hager. A diverse collection of artworks – including a sculpture by Richard Serra, art within architecture by Jenny Holzer, a sound installation by Laurie Anderson and a 60-metre-high mural by Claudia Comte – make your visit complete.\n\n\nBasel Exhibition Centre / Messe Basel\nThe new Messe Basel trade fair building is one of the city’s newer landmarks. The central architectural urban feature of the hall complex, developed by Herzog & de Meuron, is the City Lounge.\nThis covered, public space not only marks the entrance to the exhibitions, but also functions as a meeting place for locals and visitors. The architects called the prominent hole in the middle the “Fenster zum Himmel” (“window to heaven”)."

    "text": "The Student Conference Award (StCA) is available for registered postgraduate students in biostatistics to attend and present a paper at the 46th Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics, 24-28 August 2025. Approximately three awards will be granted depending on the number and quality of the applications. Selection will be made on the basis of the abstract and a summary of a paper to be presented – for details, see the eligibility criteria and submission procedure below.\nApplicants should submit their abstract using the ISCB46 abstract submission system. In the online abstract submission portal, you are asked to check the box that indicates that you are applying for the 2025 Student Conference Award on your abstract. You will then need to additionally submit the documents described in the Student Conference Award track.\nThe closing date for applications is the same as the general abstract deadline (see the key dates page).\nApplicants should not register for the conference until they have heard the outcome of their application for the Award. Unsuccessful applicants who still wish to attend the conference will remain eligible for the Early Bird rate until three weeks after the outcome of their application is sent to them."

All students may apply for the StCA independently of applying for the Conference Attendance Support Program (CASP).\nThe application must relate to original work that has not yet been published and is predominantly the student’s own work. Acceptable topics encompass all areas of biostatistics, both methodological and applied. However, results of particular studies are of interest only if the analysis has methodological implications or shows a novel and interesting application of biostatistics to clinical or epidemiological research."

Evaluation of applications will concern the quality of the research described and its relevance to the application of statistics to clinical and epidemiological research. The presentation of the application materials and the interest of the work to the ISCB members will be taken into consideration. The decisions made by the Subcommittee will be final.\nIn selecting papers for Awards, each member of the StCA Subcommittee will independently grade each paper allocated to them by the Subcommittee Chair. In the case of ties in total grades, the Subcommittee will make the final selection through discussion.\nMembers of the StCA Subcommittee must declare a conflict of interest in submissions from students with whom they have had substantial contact. Such contact certainly includes students supervised by or in the same department as Subcommittee members and may also include professional contact with the project as well as family links. The Subcommittee member with a conflict of interest in the submission will not grade it, other grades being scaled accordingly, and will not participate in discussions of that submission.\nApplicants must be able to travel to the meeting and present their work to be selected as the StCA winners.\nThe Society intends to make three awards. However, the StCA Subcommittee reserves the right to make more or fewer awards, or even none at all, subject to the approval of the ISCB President.\nApplications not selected for the StCA may still be considered for selection for an oral presentation at a Contributed Paper session or a poster presentation by the Program Committee, since the abstract has been also submitted separately via the conference abstract handling system. This holds unless the applicant indicates that they do not wish to have their submission considered further.\n\nIn case of questions, please, contact the ISCB Office at the following email: office@iscb.international."

    "text": "TODO:\n\nUpdate e-mail (sotirisroussos@yahoo.co.uk)\n\n\nFinancial support to participate in the 46th Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics is available to scientists and students from Developing Countries (Low, Lower-middle, and Upper-middle income economies, according to the World Bank list for the fiscal year 2025).\nIn order to qualify for financial support from the Conference Fund for Developing Countries (CFDC), applicants must submit an abstract for either an oral or poster presentation and be selected by the Scientific Program Committee (SPC) for presentation at ISCB46. Only original and unpublished work that has not been presented previously at a conference will be considered. One award per presentation for one author will be given, without transfer to co-authors. The awarded author’s primary place of employment/enrolment must be in a developing country. Please note that previous recipients are not eligible to apply.\nApplicants should submit their abstract using the ISCB46 abstract submission portal. As part of the online abstract submission applicants should indicate their request for consideration for financial support from the CFDC by checking the appropriate tick-box. At that time, they should also submit a PDF of a letter of application (on the official letterhead of the institution where the applicant is enrolled/employed).\nThe evaluation and selection for the CFDC award will be based on the SPC’s decision regarding the abstracts for oral/poster presentation. This will be administered by the CFDC Sub-committee comprising Thomas Jaki (ISCB Vice-President) as Chair, Elaine Pascoe (ISCB Secretary), and Sotiris Roussos (ISCB46 Local Organising Committee [LOC] representative). Any enquiry should be submitted to sotirisroussos@yahoo.co.uk, indicating in the subject line that the enquiry relates to the CFDC.\nSuccessful applicants who register for virtual participation will have the conference registration fee reimbursed. Those who register for on-site participation will be reimbursed for the cost of the conference registration fee, economy class travel, travel insurance, and reasonable costs for accommodation. Note that travel insurance is obligatory and should cover not being able to travel due to COVID-19. In case of travel restrictions imposed by authorities (e.g., a country cancelling all flights) that may not be covered by the insurance, ISCB will reimburse the incurred travel costs. Note that all the costs can only be claimed after attendance and presentation at ISCB46 and by presenting appropriate receipts. Further, claims in excess of €1300 will need prior approval from the ISCB treasurer. If, after receiving the CFDC support, a change from on-site to virtual attendance is made by choice and not necessity, only the cost of the registration fee will be compensated.\nThe CFDC will be entirely separate from the Conference Award for Scientists (CASc) administered by the National Groups Sub-committee and from the Student Conference Awards (StCA) administered by the Student Conference Awards Sub-committee. Those who apply for CASc or StCA, but are not selected, will automatically be considered for CFDC support if they qualify, and will be informed accordingly.\nThe closing date for applications is the same as the general abstract deadline."
