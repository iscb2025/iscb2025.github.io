## Session time

If you want to know your session date and time then visit the [schedule](https://www.conftool.org/iscb2025/sessions.php) online.

<b>The time allocated for a presentation is 15 minutes excluding Q&A (approx. 2 to 3 minutes).</b>

## Presentation Format

*	Your presentation should be in a <b>PowerPoint (pptx)</b>, <b>Quarto / Revealjs (HTML)</b>, or <b>PDF</b> file format. No other formats (e.g., Excel, Word or Prezi) will be accepted. 
*	All presentations will be projected in 16:9 format landscape (not 4:3) using the provided files on a Windows laptop. Revealjs presentations will be opened in the Edge browser. 
* For Quarto / Reveal.js (HTML) presentations, ensure the file is <b>fully [self-contained](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html)</b>. All assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) must be embedded in the single HTML file. External links and internet access will not be available. If this is not possible, please submit your presentation in PowerPoint or PDF format instead.
*	All presentations must be in English followed by Questions & Answers in English.
*	Keynote will not be supported because it cannot be played back on a Windows PC. Please export your presentation as MS Office 365, using filename extension ‘.pptx’.
*	Clearly <b>identify your presentation</b> with your presentation date and name in the filename (example: 20250825_John_Smith.pptx)
*	The <b>maximum file size is 30 megabytes</b>.


### Recommendations

*	Use high contrast colours; light text on dark background or vice versa.
*	Hyperlinks to external content such as websites cannot be supported.
