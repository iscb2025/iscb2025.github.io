# Conference Venue

The ISCB46 Conference will be held at two world-class institutions in
the heart of Basel, just steps away from the Rhine:

-   [Biozentrum, University of
    Basel](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/directions)\
    Spitalstrasse 41\
    CH–4056 Basel\
    Switzerland

-   [ETH Zurich \| Department of Biosystems Science and
    Engineering](https://bsse.ethz.ch/department/working-and-studying-at-d-bsse/locations.html)
    (D-BSSE)\
    Klingelbergstrasse 48\
    CH–4056 Basel\
    Switzerland

Both venues are home to leading life sciences research facilities and
are located only two minutes’ walk apart.

# Hybrid Conference Experience

All registered participants will receive personal login details for our
conference platform and mobile app, where you can explore the full
program at your fingertips. Each session includes detailed information
and abstracts, as well as a direct link to the livestream, making it
easy to join in real time. Missed a session? No problem. After the
conference, recordings will be uploaded to each session’s page so you
can catch up on anything you may have missed. Those links will be
available up to 3 months after the conference.

# Arrival & Registration

Upon arrival, participants are kindly asked to proceed to the
registration desk in the entrance hall on level U1 (-1) of the
Biozentrum. The registration desk will be open from Sunday 24 August to
Thursday 28 August 2025, between 08:00 and 17:00. Here, you will receive
your conference badge and welcome materials. Your badge must be worn
visibly at all times as it grants access to all sessions and catering
stations. Staff at the adjacent information desk will be available
throughout the conference to assist with directions or logistical
questions.

# Luggage Storage

A designated luggage storage area is available on level U1 of the
Biozentrum. Please note that this facility is not locked, and items are
left at your own risk. We recommend not leaving valuables or important
belongings unattended.

# Catering

To ensure a sustainable and inclusive experience, we provide reusable
water bottles to all participants. You will receive yours at
registration on Sunday or at the ETH BSSE handout point on Monday.
Refill stations offering both still and sparkling water are conveniently
located across both venues, and Swiss tap water is perfectly safe to
drink. Note that only closed bottles are allowed inside the lecture
halls, so please only use the water bottle during the sessions.

Coffee and tea are available before the first session each day, during
scheduled coffee breaks, and at lunchtime. During morning and afternoon
breaks, fruit and snacks will also be provided. Participants with
dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten free) can collect specially prepared
snacks at the coffee station in the ETH BSSE atrium.

Lunch catering is designed to accommodate a wide range of preferences
and dietary needs. On Sunday, a warm lunch will be served at the
Biozentrum for course participants. From Monday to Thursday, lunch bags
will be available at clearly marked distribution points in both venues.
The standard option is vegan, suitable for most participants including
those with lactose intolerance or allergies to eggs, seafood, or
shellfish. If you indicated specific dietary requirements during
registration (e.g., gluten free), your lunch will be labeled with a
sticker matching the sticker on your badge for your convenience. Special
lunch bags will be available for pickup at the ETH BSSE atrium catering
station. While we have taken care to meet most dietary restrictions, not
every individual allergy (such as avocado, chili, pineapple, or garlic)
could be indicated with a sticker on the badge. All allergens will be
clearly listed on any food item, so you can double-check yourself.
